# EU_AIR_Routes_Big_Data
This repository contains my MADSC102 Final Exam Big Data project built on Databricks, using a European air routes dataset. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data pipeline as required in the exam: ingestion, cleaning, Delta table creation, notebook exploration, SQL analytics, dashboarding, and a machine-learning bonus component.
